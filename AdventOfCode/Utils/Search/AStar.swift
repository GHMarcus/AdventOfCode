/**
 The A* search algorithm.
 Finds the shortest/cheapest path from `start` to `goal`

 - Parameters:
 - start: The initial position
 - end: The desired goal position
 - cost: The cost it takes to to traverse from `n1` to `n2`
 - heuristic: A heuristic value for the given point.
 Lower values indicate a more suitable node.
 - neighbors: The set of nodes a given node can traverse to.

 - Returns: The shortest/cheapest path from `start` to `goal`,
 or nil if no such path exists.
